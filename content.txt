1. Class and Object (examples)
2. Class has data/attributes and func/methods.
    > attributes get called itself, and methods are called manually.
3. Why python is called Object-Oriented-Programing..?
    > why construtors are used?
    > everything in python is an object(data type,data structure etc)
4. Advantages of OOP
    > you can create your own data type
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
